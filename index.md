_CruzHacks 2019 Tech Cares 1st Place Winner and UCSC Arts 2nd Place Winner_

This app was designed and created to help people overcome their stage fright and public speaking issues by simulating them in a virtual stage with a spotlight and lots of audiences. The app also analyze the speech the user makes in the virtual environment and gives helpful tips and feedback to the user so they can improve next time. I coded the website for the app and I also thought of the idea for the app.

_Winner of CruzHacks 2018 Hack Alumni's Keeping it Weird category_

This project was created to make spliting bills, taxes, and tips easier for outdoor dinings and get-togethers. Our program uses Google Vision to scan a receipt and makes a checklist of all the items and their prices as well as calculate the tax percent of the bill. I coded the tipping calculator algorithm of the project and also designed the logo.
