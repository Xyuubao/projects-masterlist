# Xiao Qing's project Masterlist

## Hi! Welcome to my masterlist of coding projects.
I am Xiao Qing Yu and I am a first year CS major currently in university. I like coding because I like to create cool and helpful programs. I really like to build stuff too.

## Hackathon projects

### Cruzhack 2018

<b/>Tip of the Day</b>: https://devpost.com/software/tip-of-the-day code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Tip-Of-the-Day
<i/> Winner of Cruzhack 2018 Hack Alumni's Keeping it Weird category </i>
This project was created to make spliting bills, taxes, and tips easier for outdoor dinings and get-togethers. Our program uses Google Vision to scan a receipt and makes a checklist of all the items and price as well as calculate the tax percent of the bill. I coded the tipping calculator algorithm of the project and also designed the logo.


## Lowell high school AP Computer Science class coding projects and assignments

<b/>Asteroid</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/AsteroidsGame/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/AsteroidsGame

This is a practice project that simulates the game Asteroid. (The restart button doesn't work properly, but the controls works fine)

<b/>Chemotaxis</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/Chemotaxis/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Chemotaxis

This is a short program that simulated a "random walk" of particles. I added a mouse sensing element where some bubble would follow the mouse and others would perform tiny random walks. 

<b/>Dice</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/Dice/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Dice

This program rolls 49 individual dice each time the mouse is clicked. The program also counts all the "dots" on the 49 dice.

<b/>Fractal Tree</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/FractalTree/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/FractalTree

<b/>Lightning</b>:  http://xyuubao.github.io/Lightning/  | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Lightning

This program simulated randomized "lightning" everytime the user clicks the screen. 

<b/>Minesweeper</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/Minesweeper/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Minesweeper

<b/>Orginal Fractal</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/OriginalFractal/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/OriginalFractal

<b/>Sierpinski Triangle</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/SierpinskiTriangle/ | code:https://github.com/Xyuubao/SierpinskiTriangle

This program creates triangles within triangles recursively.

<b/>Snowflake Catcher</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/SnowflakeCatcher/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/SnowflakeCatcher

This program is a simple simulator that catches falling snowflakes with the movement of a mouse. The snowflakes stops falling when they comes in contact with the rectangles drawn by the mouse. 

<b/>Starfield</b>: http://xyuubao.github.io/Starfield/ | code: https://github.com/Xyuubao/Starfield

This program create different types of random bubbles and display their movement.
