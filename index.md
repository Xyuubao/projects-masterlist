# Xiao Qing's project Masterlist

## Hi! Welcome to my masterlist of coding projects.
I am Xiao Qing Yu and I am a first year CS major currently in university. I like coding because I like to create cool and helpful programs. I really like to build stuff too.

## Hackathon projects

### Cruzhack 2018

**Tip of the Day**: [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/tip-of-the-day) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Tip-Of-the-Day)

_Winner of Cruzhack 2018 Hack Alumni's Keeping it Weird category_

This project was created to make spliting bills, taxes, and tips easier for outdoor dinings and get-togethers. Our program uses Google Vision to scan a receipt and makes a checklist of all the items and their prices as well as calculate the tax percent of the bill. I coded the tipping calculator algorithm of the project and also designed the logo.


## Lowell high school AP Computer Science class coding projects and assignments

**Asteroid**: [Asteroid](http://xyuubao.github.io/AsteroidsGame/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/AsteroidsGame)

This is a practice project that simulates the game Asteroid. (The restart button doesn't work properly, but the controls works fine)

**Chemotaxis**: [Chemotaxis](http://xyuubao.github.io/Chemotaxis/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Chemotaxis)

This is a short program that simulated a "random walk" of particles. I added a mouse sensing element where some bubble would follow the mouse and others would perform tiny random walks. 

**Dice**: [Dice](http://xyuubao.github.io/Dice/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Dice)

This program rolls 49 individual dice each time the mouse is clicked. The program also counts all the "dots" on the 49 dice.

**Fractal Tree**: [Fractal Tree](http://xyuubao.github.io/FractalTree/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/FractalTree)

**Lightning**:  [Lightning](http://xyuubao.github.io/Lightning/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Lightning)

This program simulated randomized "lightning" everytime the user clicks the screen. 

**Minesweeper**: [Minesweeper](http://xyuubao.github.io/Minesweeper/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Minesweeper)

**Original Fractal**: [Original Fractal](http://xyuubao.github.io/OriginalFractal/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/OriginalFractal)

**Sierpinski Triangle**: [Sierpinski Triangle](http://xyuubao.github.io/SierpinskiTriangle/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/SierpinskiTriangle)

This program creates triangles within triangles recursively.

**Snowflake Catcher**: [Snowflake Catcher](http://xyuubao.github.io/SnowflakeCatcher/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/SnowflakeCatcher)

This program is a simple simulator that catches falling snowflakes with the movement of a mouse. The snowflakes stops falling when they comes in contact with the rectangles drawn by the mouse. 

**Starfield**: [Starfield](http://xyuubao.github.io/Starfield/) [code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Starfield)

This program create different types of random bubbles and display their movement.
