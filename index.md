**Tip of the Day**: [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/tip-of-the-day):[code](https://github.com/Xyuubao/Tip-Of-the-Day)

_Winner of Cruzhack 2018 Hack Alumni's Keeping it Weird category_

This project was created to make spliting bills, taxes, and tips easier for outdoor dinings and get-togethers. Our program uses Google Vision to scan a receipt and makes a checklist of all the items and their prices as well as calculate the tax percent of the bill. I coded the tipping calculator algorithm of the project and also designed the logo.
